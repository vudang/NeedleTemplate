# Need Xcode Templates

We have created Xcode templates to generate Needle components easier. More infomation about Needle ref here: [Needles](https://github.com/uber/needle)

## Generating Needles Classes

After installing templates, Needles can be added with the New File... command in Xcode. This will generate:

[RIBName]Component
[RIBName]Interactor
[RIBName]ViewController

## Installation Instructions
Run the `install-xcode.template.sh` shell script to copy the templates to the Xcode templates folder. Once you have successfully copied the templates, when adding a new file in Xcode, the Needle group will show up.
